Glad we've become friends going all the way back to 2017(?).

Years ago we talked, but slowly we talked less and less.

## [Kim](https://twitter.com/kimzuqu)

Your server ShimaTent has been nice time. It used to be active but we all have our own responsibilities. You are very kind and understanding and you draw nice art. Can you believe it's been 3 years since I first joined?

We don't talk often but I really hope you're doing better in life.

Kind person I found via webrings online and made first contact via a guestbook. Later we moved to emails and then Discord.

## [PumaTwins](https://reddit.com/u/pumatwins)

We talked on Twitter every so often and I remember your shock when you found out our age-gap haha.

*Last message: 2022-1?-??*

## [Bezel](#none)

We used to talk for a bit more than a year, but we slowly faded away from eachother due to not agreeing with eachother. Only for months later for me to do a complete 180 and agree. But I think you have a lot of personal struggles you need time for the figure out. I still love you as a friend nontheless.
