# Who am I?

Hey there! I'm a transgender girl with a lifelong passion for technology, starting my journey into the world of computers at the age of nine. Over the years, I've become a programming enthusiast, constantly exploring the ever-evolving landscape of web development, and recently, I've delved into the fascinating realm of web3 technologies.

## Interests and Hobbies

Beyond the realms of coding, I find joy in gazing at the stars and unraveling the mysteries of the universe through astronomy. Exploring the intricacies of human behavior in the realms of psychology has always intrigued me. I'm equally passionate about contemplating life, beliefs, and the profound questions that philosophy and religion often raise.

But it's not all serious business! As a devoted fan of まふまふ (MafuMafu), I find solace and inspiration in the world of music. On a lighter note, I am allergic to liars :P.

## Language Enthusiast

Being an ESL (English as a Second Language) learner, I went on the journey of learning myself English at the age of nine. By the age of 12-13, I had achieved fluency. Currently, I'm immersing myself in other languages such as the Japanese language, a journey that began at age 14 and continues to this day.

## Future Aspirations

Looking ahead, I aspire to make a meaningful impact in the intersection of healthcare and technology. The prospect of contributing to the medical ICT world, perhaps working in a hospital setting, fuels my ambition. I believe that blending technology with healthcare is not only intellectually stimulating but also immensely gratifying, providing an opportunity to make a positive difference in the lives of others.

Life, to me, is akin to a complex puzzle, and I'm piecing it together one interest at a time. 

Feel free to reach out and connect – I'd love to share experiences, knowledge, and perhaps collaborate on something amazing.
